I had to dig deep before I finally discovered something that made a real difference.\n\n\u00a0I struggled with IBS for the past 10 years. Wherever I went, I had to make sure a bathroom was nearby\u2014or, if there wasn\u2019t one, I had to resort to the nearest forest. I constantly felt terrible, and as many of you know, dealing with diarrhea and occasional blood in the stool is not the best thing in the world.\n\n\u00a0Long story short: I don\u2019t have these issues anymore. I can eat whatever I want\u2014even though I\u2019ve transitioned from a vegetarian diet to a carnivore diet. Now, I primarily eat meat, but when I\u2019m out, I\u2019ll occasionally have pizza or whatever is available.\n\n\u00a0**The Three Things That Helped Me the Most**\n\nI tried countless remedies, but these three had the biggest impact:\n\n\u00a0**1. Ginger and Artichoke Extract**\n\nOne day, after endless searches on YouTube, I stumbled upon a video where someone recommended ginger and artichoke extract. I thought, why not give it a try? I bought them, took one capsule of each on an empty stomach, and on the very same day, my symptoms disappeared. Every now and then I take it still. Just to keep the flow.\n\n\u00a0SIBO occurs when bacteria remain in the small intestine instead of being moved out as they should. Normally, the small intestine maintains constant movement to clear bacteria, but when that process slows down, SIBO develops. Ginger and artichoke extract seem to stimulate movement in the small intestine, helping to clear out the bacteria. You\u2019ll feel the effect within 30 minutes\u2014sometimes even needing to go to the bathroom right away.\n\n\u00a0**2. Bowel Movements (Hemorrhoids) & Vitamin E**\n\nWith diarrhea, you usually don\u2019t need to strain much. However, it seems like I was pressing too hard, which sometimes caused blood in my stool (coming from the inside)\u2014small drops in the toilet. I initially assumed it was something I ate, but after researching hemorrhoids, I realized what was happening.\n\n\u00a0When you strain too much, hemorrhoids become swollen with blood. If they\u2019re overly stressed, they can start bleeding. My solution? I stopped straining and used a simple, old-school remedy: a vitamin E suppository overnight for three days. Instead of swallowing a vitamin E capsule (800 IU), I used it as a suppository, and it worked wonders.\n\n\u00a0I hope that will help you as well.",

I made a post about a month ago, maybe even longer back, about my struggling with consistent bloating after every meal no matter what i eat as an active, young person. so many people were incredibly nice and related to what i was going through and provided great suggestions for what to do next. after i made that post i saw my doctor and they didn\u2019t think that i had anything as serious as celiac (which was one of my suspicions) or SIBO. she just thought i was constipated and directed me to take a dose of a laxative daily for at least 2 weeks and then come back for stool sampling and further examination, etc. it\u2019s been a month now of doing this and here is what has happened:\n\n- i definitely needed to be going number 2 more, so that has been helpful! my morning skinny has become so much more *skinny* which made me realize that i never even know what my own body looked truly looked like.\n- it turns out i weigh like 3 pounds less than what i thought\n- but, alas, i am still getting very bloated compared to what i look like in the morning. it is all i can think about now, because genuinely, what is going on???\n\ni\u2019ve tried eating smaller meals and that definitely reduces the bloat, but it makes me hungrier! and i want to be able to enjoy normal sized meals when i go out with friends and not look pregnant afterwards. luckily, i see my doctor again this friday to see how to move forward. i\u2019m going to be very adamant about getting stool samples and other tests run to see what\u2019s going on inside me, and i\u2019m also going to inquire about endometriosis, IBS, SIBO, a low fodmap diet, and food allergy/intolerance testing.\nplease let me know if you guys can think of anything else to ask about! i\u2019ve tried yoga and it failed. i\u2019ve tried drinking water and it honestly bloats me too. this is making me depressed. i want to get better. thank you!",

I really don\u2019t want to take this antidepressant and may try low fodmap diet and maybe relax. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? Any help is appreciated \n\n",

        "A little back story: Back in May/June 2024 I got diagnosed with H Pylori and got put on antibiotics triple therapy for 2 weeks along with a probiotic supplement and pantoprazole. I got a second breath test done in July 2024 and I was negative. Still didn\u2019t feel great, so I met with a dietitian in August and suggested for me to start rebuilding my gut with probiotics through foods. I have been consistent for months but also drank alcohol 1-2x/week unfortunately so that probably didn\u2019t help with me recovering. \n\nFast forward to late December 2024: During finals week, I ate so much food out than I usually do (I basically cook each day & eat out maybe once a week). Then during the holidays baked a lot and eating foods I usually don\u2019t. \n\nThen onto January 2025, I started to feel persistent chest pain like where my sternum is and it felt so tight and uncomfortable. Then the constant burping, I would burp all the time! And I would feel a temporary relief when I do burp. I would feel the chest pain when I woke up, ate didn\u2019t eat and go to sleep. It was horrible and lasted a week and a half. I went to urgent care during the middle of the week and got an EKG to rule out heart problems and they diagnosed me with GERD/acid reflux. Prescribed me pantoprazole and metoclopramide. My dietitian recommended to not take pantoprazole since I did for months on end and don\u2019t want side effects of long term use and take metoclopramide as needed. I then didn\u2019t feel relief and went to ER. Gave me GI cocktail helped a little, did a EKG and chest xray to rule out other stuff and came out normal. After horrible week and a half, I did changes with eating, eating slowly, smaller bites and avoiding trigger foods. My chest pain went away for a solid week. \n\nThen now late January 2025, I started college again and the chest pain came back but not as severe. Lasted now for a month now. I continued going back to my normal routine of incorporating probiotic foods(kefir, yogurt, kombucha, acv, etc. ) , cooking often and eating out less. I would drink ginger tea each night. I don\u2019t drink alcohol anymore. \n\nNow, I only feel chest pain only when eating a meal and slighty after as well. I do continue to burp but only during eating and after. I also get anxious easily and always assume the worst. My dietitian thinks I might most likely have a small hiatal hernia rather than GERD but medical staff have said GERD back in January. The chest pain isn\u2019t as persistent as I was a month ago. The dietitian also thinks it\u2019s still come bacteria overgrowth as well for not being consistent during the month December. \n\nSo asking people out there, would I possibly have GERD or more of a hiatal hernia? I also am thinking possibly SIBO but that could be my anxiety talking. I\u2019m just at a lost of words because I never had a chest sensation like this ever! ",

Nowhere near where I was with poor diet, minimal exercise and unmanaged stress a few months ago. Until today! IBS sensed I was starting to relax into my healthier lifestyle and decided to put a stop to that!\n\nI ate a salad for lunch with all things I've eaten before and had no problem with - lettuce, tomato, capsicum, celery, tinned tuna, Danish feta, black olives, apple cider vinegar and olive oil dressing, toasted almonds. Lunch has always been a tricky meal for me, it seems to trigger what I think is my gastrocolic reflex, and I was often racing to the toilet with diarrhea within minutes of eating. I never have this problem with breakfast, when I am usually distracted getting my child ready for school. I will get it occasionally with dinner, if it is a big or rich/fatty meal. Since my lifestyle changes, I've had only a handful of post-lunch diarrhea incidents. \n\nI'm trying to pinpoint the cause so I can troubleshoot this. Without having thought about it too much, I put it down to gastrocolic reflex. I can't say for sure, but it feels like this happens when I think too much about what I'm eating, or am worried it might happen and I won't be able to make it to a toilet. I noticed over the festive season, eating in relaxed settings with friends and families, I never had this problem, despite eating a wide variety of foods, probably fairly heavy/fatty ones too. This has been a problem for me for decades, but I suppose now, with middle-aged me paying more attention to these things than 20-something me, I'm overthinking it more.\n\nBut, I'm wondering if anyone who has had, or knows anything about gallbladder or bile acid malabsorption could weigh in as to whether what I'm experiencing aligns with either of these two? My diarrhea is certainly not chronic as it seems to be in these two conditions, I log my BMs on the Plop app and I have data proving to me that it's not happening that often, and for the most part my BMs are in the looser range of normal. My diarrhea today was a normal brown colour like normal poo, just loose, although I have had occasional yellow diarrhea too. I don't have pain in the area usually associated with gallbladder problems. I think the only other thing that makes me wonder if it's kind of biliary-related is that for the past 2 years I have had random rashes, and am wondering if it is all related. Recent bloodwork indicated normal liver enzymes (and normal everything else too actually), but I know these can often be normal in conditions like fatty liver. I know all this wild speculation makes me sound crazy, but I'm just finding it hard to believe that all of this can be in my head.",

        "I was wondering if anyone has tried this product? I checked Trust Pilot and there aren't any reviews.\n\nI've heard about gut health being linked to aging along with many other things FOR YEARS. I do believe certain things are withheld from us to keep Big Pharma and the skin care industry in the money, but my beliefs are neither here nor there. I don't take any vitamins or supplements because I know many of them barely have any of the vitamin they are claiming to be selling actually in them so I figure why waste my money! They have tons of \"fillers\" rather than the actual vitamin. I'm not trying to look like I'm 20, I simply don't want to look older than my actual age.\n\nThis Prime Biome claims to use Babchi, Inulin, Dandelion Root Extract, B Coagulans strain, Fenugreek, Lemon Balm, Organic Ceylon Ginger, Slippery Elm Bark, Organic Lions Mane and Fennel. All of which help with many things individually (as most plants and herbs do). They also claim it is made in the US, FDA approved, did a clinical trial, etc etc etc. That their product helps restore gut health (which I personally have issues with) while also helping the skin rejuvenating process, etc, etc etc. Of course it was tested and tested and tested getting the correct amount of each plant/herb, yada yada yada until they were confident/satisfied they had it (or were close enough) and created a gummy to be taken once daily.\n\nI don't want to be taken for a fool! I don't have money to be throwing away on things that are scams (as most skin care products seem to be in my experience). The extent of my knowledge is that gut health is important and as with everything in our body, when one part isn't working properly other parts suffer and don't work as they should. Get ready for TMI...for my whole life, my bowel movement schedule is once every 1.5 - 2 weeks. This IS NOT NORMAL however, it has never concerned one doctor. Eventually I was diagnosed with IBS-C and prescribed Linzess (lowest dose). All that did was give me constant diarrhea so I decided I'd rather be backed up than not be able to be too far from a toilet.\n\nSince my husband passed nearly 4.5 years ago unexpectedly (massive heart attack at 49) I look like I've aged 10 years (due to stress I'm sure) rather than 4.5 years. This is why I have an interest when I came across this. I'm not an extremely vain person, I just don't want to look far older than my actual age.\n",

        "Hey all \u2013 I\u2019ve been on this journey since early January and wanted to share my experience to see if anyone relates.\n\nBackground - 34M, history of health anxiety \u2013 In 2018, anxiety manifested as physical symptoms (muscle twitching, headaches, chest tightness, random neurological symptoms like burning feet). Got better with Cymbalta, PT, and staying active and I stopped really thinking about anxiety in 2019. An extensive neuro workup cleared mostly everything. I started Buspar (5mg 2x/day) in 2023 due to job stress plus the loss of a close family member. Stopped in December inadvertently because I was feeling great. I feel a high stress at work triggered this flare-up in early January.\n\nCurrent Symptoms & Timeline. This whole thing started with bloating + diarrhea \u2192 Then developed tenesmus (constant rectal awareness) and stool changes the first week of January (thinner, more frequent, bits of undigested food, lighter color). Symptoms peaked late January after a work trip (3-hour flight made tenesmus worse). I\u2019ve noticed that bloating and abdominal sensations follow my food patterns, and I started seeing undigested food in softer stools (~8-12hr transit time). I also will feel \u201cbloated,\u201d but sometimes will grab where I feel that bloating sensation on my abdomen and I\u2019ll notice my jacket is really tight against my skin there, almost like it\u2019s a sensitivity. Last week I felt like everything had moderated by about 50% but since this weekend it\u2019s been rough. Mostly on the tenesmus front. \n\nGP visits & testing. Thrilled that I had a negative occult blood test 3 weeks ago. Started Align probiotic, Miralax, and Metamucil 3 weeks ago (switched to Citrucel last week, better tolerated for me). Since all of that, I\u2019ve become super regular with normal, healthy big stools. Since the weekend though, after my big regular movement each morning I\u2019ve been having smaller stingier ones that are harder to pass. My doctor and I increased Buspar to 20mg/day last week, and I have a colonoscopy + GI referral scheduled for April.\n\nConcerns & Questions - IBGard helped bloating but made BMs burn + increased tenesmus by the time it made its way out. Does that reaction make sense? Since this weekend it felt like everything has flared up again and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s lingering IBGard effects or from ramping up my Buspar. \n\nIs it normal for the bloating feelings to start in my upper abdomen right below my rib cage after I eat? And then move through my abdomen over the coming hours? I would describe the sensation as \u201cropey.\u201d\n\nHas anyone found Buspar helpful for IBS?\n\nBest ways to manage tenesmus? I feel better with warm showers + avoiding long sitting, wondering if pelvic floor tension is playing a role because I have a history of physical symptoms resulting from anxiety and muscle tension. If I could get that under control I would be thrilled.\n\nI\u2019ve been really anxious, especially since a first cousin was diagnosed with CRC at 38, but this sub has been reassuring that tenesmus + stool changes have many non-scary causes. Thanks for reading\u2014appreciate any advice, encouragement, or similar experiences! \n",

        "Ever wonder why your doctor rolls their eyes at the mention of \"leaky gut,\" while your functional medicine practitioner treats it like the holy grail of diagnoses? Welcome to one of medicine's most fascinating controversies.\n\nWhen gastroenterologists and functional medicine practitioners debate \"leaky gut,\" they're wrestling with a fascinating paradox in modern medicine. The condition \u2013 more formally known as increased **intestinal permeability** \u2013 sits at the intersection of emerging research and clinical uncertainty. But what exactly are we measuring, and why do the standards vary so dramatically across the globe?\n\nThe intestinal barrier consists of three key components: **a surface mucus layer, the epithelial cell layer, and immune defenses**. There are three different pathways in the intestine that control how substances pass between epithelial cells:\n\n1. **Leak Pathway:**\u00a0Allows larger molecules to pass through tight junctions, regulated under normal conditions.\n2. **Pore Pathway:**\u00a0Facilitates the transport of ions and small molecules through tight junctions and is highly selective.\n3. **Unrestricted Pathway:**\u00a0Linked to disease states, such as cell death, allowing bacteria and other harmful substances to pass through the intestinal barrier unchecked.\n\nPicture your intestinal barrier as an extraordinarily sophisticated security system. Testing for intestinal permeability employs various methods, each with its limitations. Zonulin Testing, which measures zonulin levels in blood or stool, has shown inconsistent results; high serum zonulin is more closely linked to metabolic markers than specific gut issues, leaving its role in diagnosing leaky gut uncertain.\n\n* Emerging markers like **lipopolysaccharide-binding protein**, a toxin produced by certain microbes, are under investigation but are not yet reliable for clinical use.\n* Elevated **fecal calprotectin** levels indicate the migration of neutrophils to the intestinal mucosa or even into the gut lumen in cases of gut barrier disturbances.\n* The **Lactulose/Mannitol Test** is the most widely utilized method for assessing intestinal permeability, primarily measured through urine collection.\n\nThis latter test employs two non-metabolized sugars: **lactulose, a larger molecule, and mannitol, a smaller one.** The fundamental premise is that lactulose is expected to pass through damaged areas of the intestinal barrier, while mannitol is thought to traverse the intestinal wall through healthy epithelial pathways.\n\nBut here's where it gets intriguing:   \n  \nIn Brazilian research published in *Scielo*, healthy individuals showed lactulose recovery of 0.07%, while celiac patients averaged 0.15%. Crohn's disease patients demonstrated levels of 0.42%. Yet the clinical interpretation of these numbers reveals a striking geographic disparity:\n\n* Australian clinicians consider 0.30% their threshold for concern.\n* U.S. laboratories set their bar significantly higher at 0.90%.\n* European standards fall somewhere in between.\n\nThis variation isn't just academic. At 0.60%, a patient might be considered perfectly healthy in Minneapolis but requiring intervention in Melbourne.\n\n# Beyond the Gut: The Bigger Picture\n\n\nResearch shows that abnormal intestinal permeability is present in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the level of permeability is lower than in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease. Studies suggest that increased permeability may precede flare-ups of Crohn's disease, indicating its role in gut inflammation. Various non-gastrointestinal diseases, including asthma, autism, and multiple sclerosis, have also been associated with leaky gut.\n\n# Understanding and Taking Action\n\n\nWhen it comes to gut barrier function, timing and triggers matter more than you might think. Your intestinal permeability isn't fixed \u2013 it can change rapidly based on your daily choices and exposures. Many common substances can temporarily increase gut permeability, including over-the-counter pain medications (NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin), alcohol, high amounts of saturated fats, and even intense exercise. The good news is that this type of increased permeability often resolves once you remove the triggering factors.\n\nCertain supplements have been proven to support gut integrity and function:\n\n* **Zinc Carnosine**\u00a0(37.5-75mg daily): Aids in maintaining tight junctions.\n* **L-Glutamine**\u00a0(5-15g daily): Provides fuel for intestinal cell repair.\n* **Probiotics**\u00a0(10-20 billion CFU): Particularly *Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG*, which has shown effectiveness in improving gut barrier function.\n* **Curcumin**\u00a0(500-2000mg daily): Known for its anti-inflammatory properties.\n* **Colostrum**\u00a0(10-60g daily): Supports mucosal integrity.\n\n# Upregulating SCFA Production Shows Particular Promise\n\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the byproducts of dietary fiber fermentation, are emerging as metabolic game-changers that play a role in metabolic health indicators like weight, glucose, insulin, and triglycerides. SCFAs are essential metabolites of probiotics, serve as a source of energy for the colonic mucosa, strengthen the intestinal protective barrier, and regenerate the colonic epithelium.\n\nResistant starch, inulin, xylooligosaccharides (a type of plant fiber), and arabinogalactan (a natural sugar found in plants) are types of dietary fibers and prebiotics that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, particularly those that produce butyrate\u2014a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) with significant health benefits.\n\n# Supporting Gut Barrier Health\n\n\nYour gut microbiome plays a vital role in maintaining a strong and healthy gut barrier. A balanced microbial community helps protect against inflammation and supports overall gut integrity.\n\n* **Good Bacteria for Gut Health:**\u00a0Beneficial microbes like *Akkermansia muciniphila* and butyrate-producing bacteria encourage mucus production and help regulate tight junctions (the \"seals\" between gut cells).\n* **Harmful Bacteria to Watch For:**\u00a0High levels of *Proteobacteria* can disrupt this balance, potentially leading to inflammation and a weakened barrier. *Bilophilia wadsworthia* is increasingly linked to leaky gut due to its ability to produce hydrogen sulfide\u2014a gas that can damage the intestinal lining.\n* **How to Strengthen Your Gut Barrier:**\u00a0Focusing on boosting butyrate producers such as *Faecalibacterium*, *Blautia*, and *Roseburia* may help maintain gut health.\n\n# Closing the Gap on Leaky Gut\n\n\nUltimately, the debate over intestinal permeability underscores the complexity of gut health and the evolving nature of medical science. While \u201cleaky gut\u201d may remain a contentious term, there\u2019s no denying that gut barrier integrity plays a crucial role in overall wellness. Whether you approach it from a clinical or functional medicine perspective, remember that your intestinal permeability is not static\u2014it responds to diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. By reducing gut-disrupting triggers and fostering beneficial gut bacteria through food-based choices, you can take meaningful steps toward optimizing your digestive health.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, feel free to check out my weekly newsletter,\u00a0[Grassroots Vitality](https://grassroots-vitality.beehiiv.com/subscribe).
