That doesn't mean it's not something else, but it is definitely a common symptom.  I had that for YEARS.  I had a colonoscopy and every other test under the sun.  I even had exploratory surgery to see if I had endometriosis, and I paid 16,000 dollars on FMT (poop pills), and nothing worked.  I know this may sound nuts, but the thing that finally cured me is nervous system regulation, and neuroplasticity training.  What I learned is that things like IBS are actually caused by being stuck in a chronic fight or flight state in your nervous system, so stress causes symptoms, and symptoms cause stress, and you body gets stuck in the state it would normally be in when you were running from a tiger (in ancient times), which is NOT conducive to things like digesting food, because, well, when a tiger's chasing you, digesting your food is not the priority.  The sucky part is, is that it is a LOT of work to do what it takes to heal this way.  The good part is, it requires no medicine and you don't need to get traditional medicine on board in order to do it, which for me was one of the hardest parts of being sick.  I hope this helps!!  Best of luck.",

                "text": "Incomplete evacuation could be related to pelvic floor issues, which a physical therapist can help evaluate and address. Do you have to strain to pass stool as well or does it just feel like aren\u2019t totally finished after a movement? Hemorrhoids can also cause the sensation of something stuck in the rectum (tenesmus), but you can have them alongside incomplete evacuation of course. If you have to strain, it can be dyssynergic defecation (anismus) aka pelvic floor. But also if the stool is sticky/greasy, it can obviously be hard to pass as well, irrespective of muscle coordination. \n\nYou may want to seek out a different GI doc who is willing to do a colonoscopy/endoscopy to confirm via biopsy the negative results of stool and blood tests, while checking for other things like inflammation and polyps. Things like celiac cannot be ruled out with a blood test alone. Gastritis due to h.pylori, frequent NSAID use, or even prolonged stress can cause stomach pain and while it\u2019s good that\u2019s resolved, endoscopy can check for that. Greasy stool can be a sign of fat malabsorption which can happen with a number of conditions. \n\nIn the meantime, gas-x can help with bloating and a heating pad is great for pain. You can also try diaphragmatic breathing, reverse kegels (bearing down while breathing out), abdominal massage, and a squatty potty or footstool (or even overturned trash bin) to help improve passage of stool. While on the toilet and outside of toileting. \n\nPush for more testing and keep advocating for yourself! It sounds like this is impacting functioning and your quality of life and that warrants further investigation. Emphasize that you eat well, drink enough water and that fiber supplements haven\u2019t helped so they don\u2019t give you the same old shtick and dismiss your concerns. \n\nETA: ask for anorectal manometry to check muscle function; motility testing (gastric emptying study, small bowel transit test) to see how food is moving through your system; breath test for SIBO (not always covered by insurance tho) given the gas issues. There are additional stool tests that can look at enzymatic production and other factors which can be helpful to rule out issues with the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, etc if appropriate.",

It took me 2-3 months to suddenly think one day: hey, I have not thought about what would happen if I had to find a toilet RIGHT NOW all day today\n\nthat was a weird feeling because urgency could come at any moment and I had to be prepared for it 24/7. The thought consumed me even in my own house. I'd panic if the only toilet in the house was occupied.\n\nI did not expect anything from the SSRI. Took it and forgot about it, went on with my daily struggles. Only around the 3 month mark did I feel the difference by that above realisation. I found out that I \\*was\\* getting better day by day, but so so slowly that it would be impossible to pinpoint when my life started becoming bearable.\n\nSo it is not a medicine you'll take and be fine for the day, like what imodium and alike promises. It will be very very gradual, like giving you 5 more better minutes every day, until you realize it is making a difference after many weeks. That was my experience. I'm sure it is impossible to imagine now, but I do go out and run my errands outside without the idea of having a sudden bout of diarrhea popping in my brain now - as that idea popping up, and my body's fight or flight response to it was the thing triggering my diarrhea - it was an destructive loop. an OCD belief that would actually become real whenever you thought about it. what a nightmare. Hope you find some relief as well.",

Combination of IBS, motility issues, extreme anxiety, autism, chronic pelvic pain from endometriosis have all made eating at different times a drag.\n\nMy best advice is you\u2019ve got to come to grips with the toilet anxiety, not just the food anxiety. Everybody poops. Pees. Etc. If it makes you feel better, even use the single disability toilet. While it\u2019s great that Imodium stops you from going, sometimes I\u2019m of the thought there\u2019s a reason why your body rejected that. Too many doctors are too willing to shrug and say it\u2019s IBS before ruling out everything else. \n\nBut I think the sooner you\u2019re okay with the bathroom, the sooner you\u2019ll find it easier to eat. You could practice going public places with toilet access when it\u2019s not a peak time to help build up your confidence.",

I think 3 weeks is definitely not long enough to tell whether it will work or not, psychiatric medications take a while to start working. The Metamucil capsules have been helping me a lot lately. The other things that help with my anxiety are vigorous exercise and yoga. Exercise does help in the moment but it's mostly good for prevention of anxiety. Yoga is better for in the moment because it forces you to focus on your body and distract your mind. Good luck, I hope your meds start helping with it.",

I can take those on days where I don\u2019t want to have my day ruined by diahrrea. The term frequent diahrrea really means \u2026 you will shit your pants. Between the time the bile shoots into your colon and the feeling that you will shit your pants gives you little to  no warning and you may or may not make it to the bathroom in time. My sister and I call them 911s. All we have to say to our families is 911 and all members know to get us to a restroom immediately we will all be in a smelly mess. To me it\u2019s super obvious it is a bile issue as my diahrrea will be full of yellow bile. I was lucky that my GI diagnosed it right away and it started pretty soon after my gallbladder was removed. I am now struggling with horrible constipation from the bile binders and have tried cholysteramine and colestipol. I think they act almost like cement in my system. I do have to take many days off of the medicine in order to finally be able to go. It\u2019s really really tough and that\u2019s why I\u2019m on this sub hoping to find some advice. But reading people\u2019s experiences with IBSD really makes me wonder if they have BAD. It\u2019s a daily struggle for me and unfortunately even with these meds I still struggle. My dr gave me dicyclomine to help with the days where I have the diarrhea so it isn\u2019t so painful and to be able to take less of the bile binder. But I\u2019m still struggling to find the balance as I still have diarrhea on that med alone but yet can also remain constipated on it as well. I have no idea how to find the right balance.",

I went on a medication called amitriptyline that definitely helped the rectal pain and the pain from IBS in general. My only beef with it is that it has caused me severe constipation to the point where smoking after quitting for 5 months is the only thing that allows me to go to the bathroom. So that would be my only warning about it. I did have constipation badly before with occasional diarrhea but was somewhat able to manage it with fiber intake, only for the amitriptyline to set me back. But no pain in my guts and rectum was a win. I\u2019d say since you don\u2019t experience constipation already, talk to your doctor about it and see what they think about a nervous system regulation drug like amitriptyline. Another thing with the hemorrhoid is that if you are straining at all to go to the bathroom, best to try preparation H suppositories. They have seemed to help me get temporary relief in the past while having a hard bowel movement, or any bowel movement, with the hemorrhoid. I also had one little one, but I actually found that it caused me pain and I could feel it. I have found that heating pads and ibuprofen have helped, not taken away, the pain and spasms in a pinch. But otherwise, I still have no idea what the spasms are or why they happen other than them possibly being related to IBS. Hoping this improves for you!",

It's well established in research that trying bile acid sequestrants is not a substitute for testing. That is because many patients don't respond adequately to bile acid sequestrants, which is due to the fact that you can have BAD/BAM for several reasons. Are you just malabsorption bile acids or is your liver overproducing them for example.\n\nHaving said that you can certainly try a sequestrant anyhow and if it works well at least you know that. Regardless of the reason. If it doesn't work however you can't say \"therefore I don't have BAM\".\n\n1. It might take a week or two to get a good answer. The onset of action is direct but you also have to feel the difference and many patients start at a lower dose and work their way up during week one. So usually you run a 1-2 week trial and see.\n2. Drugs always have risks, but these sequestrants stay in the GI tract and are therefore very safe. The main thing to look out for is to perhaps supplement fat soluble vitamins when you're not taking the meds. Also avoid taking other drugs with the sequestrant as they can impair uptake.\n3. You could, difficult to separate the experiences in that way.\n\nYou could also do a stool collection test which can identify bile acids to a adequate degree as well.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\n[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17474124.2024.2402353](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17474124.2024.2402353)\n\n[https://www.dldjournalonline.com/article/S1590-8658(24)01144-7/fulltext](https://www.dldjournalonline.com/article/S1590-8658(24)01144-7/fulltext)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvTKEwAhewE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvTKEwAhewE)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSResearch/comments/1hu3of8/it\\_seemed\\_like\\_irritable\\_bowel\\_syndrome\\_but\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBSResearch/comments/1hu3of8/it_seemed_like_irritable_bowel_syndrome_but_it/)\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10524409/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10524409/)\n\n[https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(24)00291-7/fulltext](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(24)00291-7/fulltext)",

It makes my body chronically enflamed and I think this is causing a reaction.\n\nBut this is just my feeling.\nI also suspect i have POTS and EDS which also report to cause gastro issues\u2026 but have no diagnosis for that (yet). Another comorbid diagnosis is mcas (which is about histamine intolerance)\n\nFrom what I have read over the years about IBS, I feel like ibs isn\u2019t a diagnosis on itself. It\u2019s more like: you have these symptoms but we don\u2019t know what it is so we just call it ibs.

I had the same low iron problem & it fixed that real quick)\n\nI don't see anything about Fodmaps. After years of diarrhea, bloating & painful hemorrhoids from it all, I was desperate. I saw a GI Dr who also has IBS-. He gave me a Fodmaps list to follow. \n\nI stayed on it strictly for 2yrs....much longer than I should have, but he didn't say it was an elimination diet.. He stays on it & I didn't do my research. It \"cured\" the diarrhea. If you're already malnourished, gotta supplement with vitamins & add calories, because in my case I lost 14lbs in that 2yr period & it's hard for me to lose weight. I didn't eat after dinner, to give my stomach a long rest. Research isn't clear on this, but it helped me personally. \n\nIt didn't cure the IBS completely, but definitely helped.\nEventually I added more foods to the diet. I gained weight, which I'm now trying to get off... I still get bloated but probiotics, gas pills, cramp pills, peppermint oil, peppermint tea & occasional anxiety meds help some. The gut has its own brain & nerves which are hypersensitive.\n\nTo answer your original question, no other diagnosis has ever been given, despite CT scans, gallbladder tests, etc.\nIt sucks but it's kinda life long learning on what your triggers are. I exercise a few times a week - 1hr cardio, 1 hr weight training. If I stay still too long, I get super bloated despite following all the \"rules\"",

It runs strongly in my family and at this point I cope as best I can. The only tests I haven\u2019t had at this point are motility and pelvic floor function which I\u2019m sure I have some level of pelvic floor dysfunction. \n\nAnd like others have said im sure my menstrual cycle plays a major role in my IBS. I suspect I have endo to some level as my inter-abdominal inflammation goes crazy before my period. I also have rib/muscular issues in my floating ribs and those ALWAYS also flare up around my period. My primary doc is convinced my rib issues are mostly inflammation which increases every month with my period. Unfortunately as others have mentioned I think there is lack of collaboration between gynecologist and gastros when it comes to talking about a whole of system approach to IBS and I\u2019m sure hormone cycles and even endo play a major role in the disease for many women.",

I have been struggling with my weight all my life and after a year of eating a fodmap restricted diet I am down almost 50lbs!! I have always been a healthy eater, worked out and counted calories and all that did was kept me barely teetering on the brink between obese and morbidly obese. I am now at the top end of my healthy weight. Constant cortisol also stops us from properly absorbing nutrients and makes our bodies and organs hold on to excess fat. Not to mention all the other health issues that the doctors couldn't explain that just vanished when I started this. Everything from bad skin to female health stuff to brain fog and chronic fatigue. \nIt's unfathomable to me that we are not approaching medicine as treating the whole human, mind, body and spirit. Holistic (treating the whole person) is a dirty word and I get scoffed at when I ask if a doctor believes in a Holistic approach. \nTook me way longer to figure this out than it should have in this modern age. \nBest of luck on your journey and thank you for sharing this!",

I would maybe get an endoscopy and/or test for Heliobacter pylori. A typical nutrient deficiency in vegitarianism is zinc, which is needed for producing enough stomach acid. B vitamins, salt, iron are also needed. When there isnt enough, bacteria can colonise the stomach. They can attack the acid producing cells and their waste can neutralise the stomach acid. Having enough stomach acid is needed for breaking down the food to access the nutrients and it also can prevent reflux (counterintuitivly). You could use antimicrobial herbs on an empty stomach to reduce the bacteria there. Some people supplement stomach acid with Betaine HCL, but if you do start with a very low dose and see if you tolerate it well. You could also try supplementing zinc (no zinc oxide) and B vitamins.\n\nThis channel has some good information [https://www.youtube.com/@KickItNaturally](https://www.youtube.com/@KickItNaturally)",

That\u2019s a lot! I\u2019m no expert though but I would suggest you going to a different doctor. What symptoms do you have? Have you been diagnosed with gastritis? Cause that\u2019s what mostly what h pylori causes and you should look into treating that if you can\u2019t eliminate the h pylori. Do you have a partner or have family you live with? Do they have it? Because it can be transmitted easily. Being h pylori positive doesn\u2019t say much because a lot of people have it without the symptoms, and they won\u2019t be given antibiotics for it because it is in a small number. But if it\u2019s causing you severe symptoms it\u2019s definitely a problem to address but 5 rounds of antibiotics are definitely not a solution! It will destroy your stomach flora even more. Even in the present are you sure your symptoms are not due to the many courses of antibiotics you already took? Are you doing anything to heal your stomach flora? I had/ have stomach problems for almost 2 years as well had h pylori did 2 rounds of treatment but after that my stomach was a mess just in different ways because those antibiotics are extremely strong! My doctor said h pylori could come positive again but not to worry about that but rather heal my flora because if it\u2019s damaged it\u2019s easy for it to come back again. I\u2019m not 100% yet but definitely feeling 50 times better than I did last year. Find a really good gastroenterologist!",

Fast forward about 15 years with additional health concerns and I found my way to an integrative physician who put me on the right path and I finally was able to feel \"normal\".  It wasn't a struggle anymore. So my diet improved and I no longer ate certain things: gluten, dairy. Sometimes it's a grind and I have felt excluded because of all the things I can't have, but that matters less and less as time goes by. You just want to sit down and enjoy a meal without constantly calculating whether it's going to help or hurt your gut, right?\n\n It sounds like you have a lot more stuff going on. The important thing is that you seem to have a physician that is listening to you. It's a journey . It may be helpful to keep a journal of your progress. Never give over your agency to anyone doctor or doctrine. You may also get some help doing meditation. You are a whole person and no one discipline, medicine, or vitamin will be a silver bullet.

This type takes longer to digest, so it feeds a lot of your microbes at the end of your digestive tract. If these microbes aren\u2019t fed, they can eat your gut lining and make you more susceptible to illness and infection. Good luck! I hope you feel better soon :)",
